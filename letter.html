  <h1>To My Favorite Person 💖</h1>

  <p>
    Happy Birthday Bebe. Today is special not just because it’s your Janamdin,
    but because it reminds me how lucky I am to have you in my life bubu.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though we are miles apart right now, not a single day goes by
    where I don’t think about you. Your vns of kissies, your videos, the way you
    understand me makes my hardest days feel lighter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long distance isn’t easy, but loving you makes it worth it.
    Every text, every conversation, every moment with you means more to me
    than you probably realize.
  </p>

  <p>
    I dream of the day when I don’t have to celebrate your birthday
    through a screen, but right next to you by holding your hand,
    annoying you, and making memories we'll cherish 4ever and ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tab tak, just know this I’m always with you, cheering for you,
    believing in you, and loving you more every single day meri jaan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Happy Birthday once again, my one and only pasandida aurat. 
  </p>

  <p><b>Forever yours,<br>Sachin ❤️</b></p>
