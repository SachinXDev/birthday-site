  <h1>One day… 💍</h1>

  <p>
    One day fs, I won’t have to look at you through this mf screen.
    I’ll get to sit next to you and hold your hand,
    and celebrate moments exactly the way they should be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until that day comes, I promise to be patient with the distance,
    honest with my feelings, and always there for you 
    even on the days when you feel heavy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I promise to support your dreams,
    stand by you when things get difficult,
    and choose you every single day bubu.
  </p>

  <p>
    This distance is only temporary.
    What I feel for you isn’t.
  </p>

  <p><b>Always yours,<br>Sachin ❤️</b></p>
